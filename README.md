# ðŸ’¼ Portfolio Repository

ðŸš€ Welcome to my **Portfolio Repository**.  
Iâ€™m a software engineer focused on integrating **ML/AI** â€” especially **LLMs** â€” into real-world systems.  
Here you'll find full-stack projects featuring intelligent chatbots, API automation, and cloud deployments.  
Each project reflects my core strengths: **scalable architecture**, **automation**, and **clean UX**.  
Tech stack highlights include: `Vue & Nuxt`, `Python`, `Flask`, `SQLAlchemy`, `SQL Server`, `OpenAI API`, `Docker`, and other modern frameworks.
ðŸ”— Explore, clone, or reach out â€” I'm always open to collaboration and problem-solving.
